## Instructions

Click a pair of cards to show their icon. If the icons match, 
the cards will stay face up and a different color to denote they 
are a match. Games are timed based on the first click. The game 
is won when all cards are face-up and matched. Your final score 
includes the time taken to match all the cards, the total amount 
of moves, and a star rating based on the # of moves that you made.

Click the reset button to reset the cards, moves, and timer.
